//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////

// Use ES6 syntax to create a new class called Shape.
// The constructor function of the class should store the number of sides passed in a property called sides.
// Each Shape created from this class should have access to a function in the class called report. Report should return the number of sides the shape has. 
// Use the class to create create three new variables, called triangle, square, and pentagon. Give each new variable the correct number of sides when creating it.
//

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////

// Create a constructor function called Cohort that can be used to generate DevMountain cohorts. 
// The function should take information about a program, a campus, a number, and an array called students (the students array should contain at least 3 student names).
// The function should also contain two methods:
//  1. sayName - A function that generates an abbreviated name for the cohort. The code should return this string: "This cohort is called " + the program, campus, and number passed in.
//  2. takeAttendance - A function that console.logs the array of students in the cohort.
// After you've made the constructor, use it to create two new cohort objects, named cohort1 and cohort2:
// cohort1 should have a program of "w", a campus of "pr", a number of 27, and an array of strings containing at least 3 student names. 
// cohort2 should have a program of "w", a campus of "pr", a number of 31, and an array of strings containing at least these 4 student names: "Brendan Eich", "Dan Abramov", "Wes Bos", "Kent Dodds", and your name.
// After creating the new cohorts, invoke the sayName method on cohort1, and invoke the takeAttendance method for cohort2.
