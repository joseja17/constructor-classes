//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////

// Use ES6 syntax to create a new class called Shape.
// The constructor function of the class should store the number of sides passed in a property called sides.
// Each Shape created from this class should have access to a function in the class called report. Report should return the 
// number of sides the shape has. 
// Use the class to create create three new variables, called triangle, square, and pentagon. Give each new variable the 
// correct number of sides when creating it.
//

class Shape{
    constructor(sides){
        this.sides = sides;
        
    }
    report(){
        return this.sides
    }
}

var triangle = new Shape(3);
var square = new Shape(4);
var pentagon = new Shape(5);



//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////

// Create a constructor function called Cohort that can be used to generate DevMountain cohorts. 
// The function should take information about a program, a campus, a number, and an array called 
// students (the students array should contain at least 3 student names).
// The function should also contain two methods:
//  1. sayName - A function that generates an abbreviated name for the cohort. The code should return 
// this string: "This cohort is called " + the program, campus, and number passed in.
//  2. takeAttendance - A function that console.logs the array of students in the cohort.
// After you've made the constructor, use it to create two new cohort objects, named cohort1 and cohort2:
// cohort1 should have a program of "w", a campus of "pr", a number of 27, and an array of strings containing
//  at least 3 student names. 
// cohort2 should have a program of "w", a campus of "pr", a number of 31, and an array of strings containing
//  at least these 4 student names: "Brendan Eich", "Dan Abramov", "Wes Bos", "Kent Dodds", and your name.
// After creating the new cohorts, invoke the sayName method on cohort1, and invoke the takeAttendance method for cohort2.

class Cohort {
    constructor(program, campus, number, students){
        this.program = program;
        this.campus = campus;
        this.number = number;
        this.students = students;
    }
    sayName(){
        return "This cohort is called " + this.program + this.campus + this.number
    }
    takeAttendance(){
        console.log(this.students)
    }
}

var cohort1 = new Cohort("w", "pr", 27, ["Pedro", "Pablo", "Juan"]);
var cohort2 = new Cohort("w", "pr", 31, ["Brendan Eich", "Dan Abramov", "Wes Bos", "Kent Dodds", "Jose"]);

sayName(cohort1);
takeAttendance(cohort2);
